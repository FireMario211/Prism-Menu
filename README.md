**Prism Menu** is a Geode mod that intends to be a free alternative to other mod menus, while also adding extra useful additions.

# Features 
* **Tons of different mods**
    * By default, **Prism Menu** comes with lots of mods / hacks that are in most mod menus! While the current amount is low, I plan on adding more as I update this mod.
* **Custom Themes**
    * You can use the default themes present, create your own theme, or use theme made by others!
    * Currently, there are 3 themes available: `Future Dark`, `Light`, & `Catppuccin`, but you can create your own theme and share it with others on the Discord Server, or (in the future) in the game itself!
* **Multi-Language Support**
    * Prism Menu supports more languages than **English,** it supports **Spanish**, **French**, **Portuguese** (Brazilian), **German**, **Russian**, **Czech**, and many more! Thanks to the translators!
* **Replay Bot** (Quartz)
    * Prism Menu comes with a bot known as **Quartz!** (QBot or Quartz Bot)
    * **Quartz** supports GDR (GD Replay Format), meaning you can use your pre-existing macros on it.
    * **Quartz** also comes with a **Macro Editor**, making the recording process easier incase you made a mistake!
* **Cross Platform**
    * Prism Menu is available on `Windows`, `Mac`, and `Android`!
    * Soon, it may also be available on `iOS`!

# How to use 
Press on the circle button located on the left corner, or press `Tab` to open the menu!

# Known issues
- Entering a level can crash your game on Android32 in v1.8.0
    - Current workaround is to downgrade to the v1.7.4 version of Prism Menu, or upgrade to the 1.8.2 version of Prism Menu or later.
   - [Download link for v1.7.4](https://github.com/FireMario211/Prism-Menu/releases/download/v1.7.4/firee.prism.geode)
- Most likely in platformer, Macro Editor has a bug where the hold button clicks really fast
   - [Video of the bug](https://prism.tixte.co/hold.mp4) (volume warning)
- Frame Fix may teleport the player to random positions
   - This depends on whether the player died in practice mode and cause an "inaccuracy"
- Macro Editor may not show the changes real time
