This mod menu also provides unique features not present in most mod menus, here are a few examples.
## Tons of different mods
* Prism Menu by default comes with <cy>a lot of mods / hacks</c> that are in most mod menus! While the current amount is low, I plan on adding more as I update this mod.
## Custom Themes
* You can use the set themes present here, or create/import your own theme!
* Currently, there are 2 themes available: `Future Dark`, `Light`, & `Catppuccin`, but you can create your own theme and share it with others!
