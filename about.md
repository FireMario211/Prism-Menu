# Prism Menu
**By [Firee](user:6253758)**
A mod that intends to be a free alternative to other mod menus, while also adding extra useful additions. (Press `Tab` to open menu)

This mod menu also provides unique features not present in most mod menus, here are a few examples.
## Tons of different mods
* Prism Menu by default comes with a lot of features present in most mod menus! While the current amount is low, I plan on adding more as I update this mod.
## Custom Theming
* You can use the set themes present here, or create/import your own theme!
* Currently, there are 2 themes available: `Future Dark` and `Catppuccin`, but you can create your own theme and share it with others!

## Multiple Language (Not Done)
* Currently English is only supported, but this will change in the next update.
## Cross Platform
* Prism Menu is available on both `Windows` and `Android`!

Note: For Android, there may be an update soon that will make it easier to use the menu in case the buttons look too small / is hard to use.
