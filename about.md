![Mod Example](firee.PrismMenu/Screenshot1.png)
This mod menu also provides unique features not present in most mod menus, here are a few examples.
## Tons of different mods
* Prism Menu by default comes with a lot of mods / hacks that are in most mod menus! While the current amount is low, I plan on adding more as I update this mod.
## Custom Themes
* You can use the set themes present here, or create/import your own theme!
* Currently, there are 2 themes available: `Future Dark`, `Light`, & `Catppuccin`, but you can create your own theme and share it with others!

## Multi-Language Support
* Prism Menu supports more languages than **English,** it supports **Spanish**, **French**, **Portuguese** (Brazilian), **German**, **Russian**, **Czech**, and many more!
## Replay Bot (Quartz)
* Prism Menu comes with a bot known as **Quartz!** (QBot or Quartz Bot)
* **Quartz** supports GDR (GD Replay Format), meaning you can use your pre-existing macros on it.
* **Quartz** also comes with a **Macro Editor**, making the recording process easier incase you made a mistake!
## Cross Platform
* Prism Menu is available on `Windows`, `Mac`, and `Android`!
